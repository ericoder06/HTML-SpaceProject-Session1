        <p class="space-description">
            Mercury, the smallest and closest planet to the Sun, is a rocky world with a surface marked by extremes. Named after the Roman messenger god, Mercury's surface temperatures can vary dramatically, ranging from scorching hot during the day due to its proximity to the Sun, to frigidly cold at night when it lacks a substantial atmosphere to retain heat.

            With a surface covered in craters and plains, Mercury bears the scars of intense bombardment from space debris. Despite its small size, Mercury has a relatively large iron core, making it one of the densest planets in our solar system.
            
            Mercury's lack of a significant atmosphere exposes it to the full force of the solar wind and radiation. As a result, its surface has undergone extensive geological changes, including the formation of cliffs and ridges due to the planet's contracting and cooling over time.
            
            While Mercury is challenging to observe from Earth due to its proximity to the Sun, spacecraft missions like NASA's MESSENGER (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) have provided valuable insights into this enigmatic planet, shedding light on its composition, magnetic field, and history.</p>

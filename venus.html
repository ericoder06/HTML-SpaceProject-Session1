            Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is a striking yet inhospitable world often referred to as Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and mass. Named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, Venus is a rocky planet with a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide.

            One of the most notable features of Venus is its extreme surface temperatures, which can reach up to about 465 degrees Celsius (869 degrees Fahrenheit). This intense heat is a result of the planet's greenhouse effectâ€”its thick atmosphere traps solar radiation, preventing it from escaping.
            
            Venus has a slow and retrograde rotation, meaning it rotates on its axis in the opposite direction to most planets in our solar system. The surface is marked by vast plains, highland regions, and volcanic structures. One of the prominent features is Maxwell Montes, the highest mountain on Venus.
            
            Despite its challenging conditions, Venus has been the target of numerous spacecraft missions aimed at studying its atmosphere and surface. These missions have provided valuable data, revealing insights into the planet's geology, atmospheric composition, and the mechanisms behind its unique rotation.
            
            Venus remains a subject of scientific interest, with ongoing efforts to understand its complex climate and geological history. The exploration of Venus contributes to our broader understanding of planetary evolution and the potential for habitability beyond Earth.</p>
